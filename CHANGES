This is the C SDK for EdgeX. It is based largely on the Go SDK but the API
differs as follows:

* Adding devices in the "discovery" callback is done using an API function call
  rather than directly returning the new devices.
* Asynchronous device readings are submitted using an API function call rather
  than Go's "channel" facility.
* A "Driver" section in the configuration file is introduced for driver-specific
  configuration elements. A list of name-value pairs is passed to the
  implementation during startup.
* A "DeviceList" section in the configuration file is introduced for fixed
  device definitions. These are uploaded to core-metadata during startup.
* An API call is introduced which provides access to the device profiles which
  are known to the service.

Changes for Delhi release (0.7.0):

- Consul is supported for registration and configuration.
-   New configuration option Service.CheckInterval controlling how frequently
    the registry polls the device service for liveliness.
-   Driver init functions get their configuration as a name-value pair list
    rather than a TOML table.
-   SDK start function now takes parameters for Consul's hostname and port. They
    are no longer included in the configuration file.

- "Discovery", "DataTransform" and "ReadMaxLimit" configuration options are now effective.

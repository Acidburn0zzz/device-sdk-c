This is the C SDK for EdgeX. It is based largely on the Go SDK but the API
differs as follows:

* The callback function for the "device" endpoint is separated into get and put
  variants.
* Adding devices in the "discovery" callback is done using an API function call
  rather than directly returning the new devices.
* Asynchronous device readings are submitted using an API function call rather
  than Go's "channel" facility.
* A "Driver" section in the configuration file is introduced for driver-specific
  configuration elements. A parsed structure is passed to the implementation
  during startup.
* A "DeviceList" section in the configuration file is introduced for fixed
  device definitions. These are uploaded to core-metadata during startup.
* An API call is introduced which provides access to the device profiles which
  are known to the service.
